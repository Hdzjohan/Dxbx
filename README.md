# Dxbx
Xbox1 emulator

Dxbx started out as a translation of Cxbx, world's first Xbox emulator.
(Development on Cxbx has ceased, but it's Cxbx-Reloaded fork is where current development takes place.)

Dxbx reached some milestones Cxbx never reached, but nowadays Dxbx project is permanently dormant.
Still, Dxbx offers some substantial benefits over it's Cxbx (and even present-day Cxbx-Reloaded) siblings, like a generic symbol-scanning engine, an Xbe executable viewer and other stuff.

Anyone still wanting to experiment with this code, could try to get it compiling and running using Delphi Starter Edition (https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter)
